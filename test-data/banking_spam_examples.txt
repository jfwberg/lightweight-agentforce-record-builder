Reason for score:
- Plausible fraud-check scenario and neutral tone
- Does not ask for passwords or full card details, only a yes/no reply
- However, no bank name, no partial card number, and no reference to official contact channels
- Could be a genuine minimal notification or a well-written spoof — needs a human to verify headers, sender domain and context
