CALL TRANSCRIPTION – HORIZON UTILITIES SUPPORT

Agent (A): Thank you for calling Horizon Utilities Customer Care, this
is Maya speaking. How can I assist you today?

Customer (C): Hi Maya. Before anything, my account number is
ACC-98457231. I figured I’d just start with that.

A: Perfect, thank you for that. Let me pull up your account… alright, I
have it here. What seems to be going on?

C: Honestly, I’m a bit frustrated. My latest bill is almost double what
I normally pay. And nothing in my home usage has changed. So I’m calling
to complain because it doesn’t seem right.

A: I completely understand your concern, and I’m really sorry you’re
dealing with that. Let me dig into your usage history… okay, I can see
there was a sudden spike on the 10th and 11th of this month. That
definitely looks unusual. What I’d like to do is raise a billing
investigation case so our team can take a closer look. Would that be
okay?

C: Yes, please. I’d appreciate that.

A: Great, I’m opening the case now. I’ll include details about the spike
and the normal usage pattern. Sometimes faulty meters or temporary
surges can cause this. Our team will get back to you once they’ve
reviewed everything.

C: That sounds good.

A: If our billing team needs additional info, when would be the best
time for a callback?

C: I work until late most days… could you schedule it for next
Wednesday, the 29th? Around 6 PM works best for me.

A: Absolutely. I’ll set up a follow‑up task for Wednesday the 29th at
18:00. You’ll get a reminder and one of our specialists will contact you
then.

C: Perfect. Thanks for working around my schedule.

A: Of course! Before we wrap up, I noticed you recently browsed our
website’s Home Solutions section. Were you looking into any new
products?

C: Yeah, actually. I was reading about your Smart Home Energy Monitor.
I’m wondering if that would help me track usage more accurately so I can
avoid surprises like this.

A: That’s a very common question! The Smart Home Energy Monitor is great
for real‑time tracking. It shows which appliances draw the most power,
creates daily and weekly usage reports, and sends alerts if something
suddenly spikes. What were you hoping it would help you with
specifically?

C: Mostly identifying which appliances are responsible for most of my
bill. And I’d definitely like alerts for weird spikes, especially since
this whole situation stressed me out.

A: It’s perfect for that. A lot of customers say it’s helped them catch
problems early—like malfunctioning heaters or fridges running too long.
If you’d like, I can arrange for one of our product consultants to reach
out and walk you through pricing, installation, and options.

C: Yes, that would be great. I’m seriously thinking of buying one.

A: Wonderful, I’ll make a note to have our team contact you about the
Smart Home Energy Monitor package. They usually reach out within 1–2
business days.

C: Great. I’ll keep an eye out for that call.

A: Is there anything else I can help you with today?

C: Nope, that covers everything. Thanks again for your help.

A: You’re very welcome. Thank you for calling Horizon Utilities and have
a great day!
